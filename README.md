# COM_Workshop_ITECH2020
## Introduction
Dear participants,
<p>Our workshop day will start with a lecture that will focus on general electronic and machine-to-machine (m2m) communication followed by a workshop where we will write together some simple m2m communication workflows using the Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) protocol. In the end of the workshop you will be hopefully confident and able to design communication strategies for your project(s) using MQTT.</p>

The day will be divided into several parts (time is only tentative):
1. (60 min) Lecture focusing on basics of electronic communication and standard communication patterns and protocols. 
2. (30 min) Discussion and questions.
3. (30 min) Explanation of MQTT with demonstration.
4. (45 min) Exercise: A simple chat communication workflow over the internet using MQTT.
5. (45 min) Exercise: Deploying your own Mosquitto MQTT broker and running several examples using Grasshopper.
6. (60-90 min) Presentation of your projects and discussion.
7. (rest of the time) Group work with me running (virtually) around OR and explanation of some more specialized workflow or example relevant to everyone

If we still have time we can also briefly go over representational state transfer (REST).
We will also fit our lunch break somewhere in between.

## Prerequisites
In order to have a smooth workshop experience and to avoid wasting time I put together a list of simple requirements you have to do before the workshop starts. We will use Windows and work a lot with Python and I will assume you have a good knowledge of both Python and OOP. The preferred setup is the one I will be using during the workshop on my computer. If you want to use some other setup you are welcome to do so but don't expect my support if things don't work as they should.

*Short project presentation:*
1. Prepare short (max 5 min) presentations of your group or semestral or pavilion projects. Ideally we will integrate MQTT communication in your own projects.

*Install WSL and Ubuntu for Windows:*
1. Install and enable Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL2)
	- https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10
2. Install Ubuntu
	- https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/ubuntu-on-windows#1-overview

*Install and configure Iron Python 2.7.8:*
1. Install Iron Python (ipy)
	- https://github.com/IronLanguages/ironpython2/releases/tag/ipy-2.7.8
2. Configure IRONPYTHONPATH and PATH Environmental variables
	- Append ipy installation folder path (probably `C:\Program Files\IronPython 2.7`) to your PATH environmental variable
	- Create new environmental variable called IRONPYTHONPATH and set it to your ipy.exe path (probably `C:\Program Files\IronPython 2.7\ipy.exe`
	- Test your installation by starting a new terminal (PowerShell or Command Prompt) and typing `ipy -V`. It should show in your terminal `IronPython 2.7.8 2.7.8.0 on .NET 4.0.30319.42000` (or very similar). If it does not you did something wrong and you have to fix it (use google or send me an email).
3. Install pip for ipy
	- Open terminal (PowerShell or Command Prompt) as admin and run `ipy -m ensurepip` 
	- After installation finishes go to your ipy installation folder and copy `pip.exe` from Scripts to the root ipy installation folder.
	- Finally rename `pip.exe` in the ipy installation folder to `ipip.exe`
	- Test your installation by starting a new terminal (PowerShell or Command Prompt) and typing `ipip -V`. It should show in your terminal `pip 8.1.1 from c:\program files\ironpython 2.7\Lib\site-packages (python 2.7)` (or very similar). If it does not you did something wrong and you have to fix it (use google or send me an email).
	- Test your installation by typing `ipip install pyyaml`.
4. Configure python extra paths in Rhino
	- Open Rhino and go to `Tools>Python Script>Edit...`
	- In the Python Script window go to `Tools>Settings` and click on an icon `Add to search path`
	- Select the `Lib/site-packages` folder from your ipy installation folder (probably `C:\Program Files\IronPython 2.7\Lib\site-packages`) and press `OK`
	- You might need to restart your Rhino before the new path is picked up by Python (I am unsure about that).
	- Test your setup by opening Grasshopper, putting GhPython Script component on a canvas and writing `import yaml`. Run your GhPython Script component and if it does not show an error all is good.

*Install Python 3 (if you don't have it already):*

1. If you are working with several Python version on Windows please read https://stackoverflow.com/a/57504609/7597893
2. Install Python 3 and add setup environmental variables:
	- clean install: https://www.python.org/downloads/
	- Anaconda distribution (gives you some additional functionality and preinstalled packages): https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual
3. Install pip
	- https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_pip.asp

*Install Visual Studio Code:*

1. Install VSCode for Windows 
	- https://code.visualstudio.com/
2. Open VSCode and install the following extensions (how to install extensions: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/extension-gallery):
   - Python: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python
   - GitHub: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=KnisterPeter.vscode-github
   - If you want the exact same look as mine then download the following color and icon theme:
     - https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=akamud.vscode-theme-onedark
     - https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=qinjia.seti-icons
